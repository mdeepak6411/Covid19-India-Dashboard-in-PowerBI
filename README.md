# Covid19-India-Dashboard-in-PowerBI

In this project, I have analyzed the Covid-19 India dataset, an open-source dataset from Kaggle, and built interactive dashboards showing a complete covid19 summary of every state of India. The dashboard also indicates the top infected states and total confirmed cases over time. and in this project, I have used some interactive third-party visuals which makes our dashboard more meaningful.
